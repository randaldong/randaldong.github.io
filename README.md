## 1. General Gameplay Design

### 1.1 Overall Mission

Two players are placed at separate scenes. They have to collaborate to solve puzzles and find clues in the scene, helping each other to collect the missing parts of the ancient stone tablet that opens the door to the next unknown……

### 1.2 Character Setting

- Player 1 (Apolonia, relating to Apollo, representing rational thinking and order, logic and reason, prudence and discipline)
- Player 2 (Dion, relating to Dionysus, representing irrationality, chaos, passion, emotions, and instincts)

(from Friedrich Nietzsche [§ Apollonian and Dionysian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Apollonian_and_Dionysian) in [The Birth of Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy))

In this game, these two spirits are inextricably entwined by the force of nature. Though players are initially separated into different scenes, they must unite as a team, collaborating to gather useful information and solve puzzles by interacting with their surroundings. Once they have located all of the ancient tablet fragments scattered throughout their surroundings, and pieced them together in their proper place, the ornately carved wooden door shall open before them, revealing the culmination of their collective efforts. At this moment, they shall witness the magnificent merging of their memories, previously disparate droplets, into a single, continuous river, restoring their fractured spirits to wholeness once more.

### 1.3 Task Setting

#### 1.3.1 Apolonia’s Tasks

Apolonia’s Tasks are more related to logic. The player can solve the problems (which can be very difficult) by brute force, or there might be some short-cuts to be explored…

Interaction design for Apolonia would be focused on selection & manipulation.

#### 1.3.2 Dion’s Tasks

Dion’s Tasks are more related to arts. Optical illusions and surrealism ideas would be used for the task design of Dion.

## 2. Selection & Manipulation Design

Direct interactor & interactable, Ray interactor & interactable will be used for Apolonia to finish her tasks.

### 2.1 Solving a Rubik's Cube

Rotating the cube by sliding on the table.

Short-Cut Hint:

"Playing with the Cube is like having a conversation with it. You have to listen to what it tells you. It speaks to you in its own language, and if you want to understand it, you have to learn that language." 

– Erno Rubik, inventor of the Rubik's Cube

### 2.2 To be designed…

## 3. Travel & Navigation Design

Dion will be travelling the the world of paintings, both western and eastern masterpieces. His movement will be controlled by hand-tracking. A painting brush will be acting as an elf that guides the way. Hints on which direction to choose when Dion reaches a fork in the road are based on quotes in famous poems, lyrics, or novels. Dion may also be asked to chant a spell (which uses the technique of voice input) so that the puzzles will be solved.

## 4. System control & Symbolic Input Design

### 4.1 Calp Hands

Two players clap their hands in front of their headsets to activate the animation and enter the final scene, uncover the secret behind all these, and come to the culmination of their adventure.4.2 To be designed…

## 5. User Interface Design

Each player has their corresponding menu/tools/skills.

### 5.1 Menu

#### 5.1.1 Apolonia

Apolonia’s menu will be the left brain (logic related elements) + the sun & harp (Apollo related elements)

#### 5.1.2 Dion

Dion’s menu will be the right brain (art related elements) + the moon & whine (Dionysus related elements)
