## 1. General Gameplay Design

### 1.1 Overall Mission
Two players are placed at separate scenes. They have to collaborate to solve puzzles and find clues in the scene, helping each other to collect the missing parts of the ancient stone tablet that opens the door to the next unknown……

### 1.2 Character Setting
* Player 1 (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Apolonia</span>, relating to Apollo, representing rational thinking and order, logic and reason, prudence and discipline)
* Player 2 (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dion</span>, relating to Dionysus, representing irrationality, chaos, passion, emotions, and instincts)
(from Friedrich Nietzsche [§ Apollonian and Dionysian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Apollonian_and_Dionysian) in [The Birth of Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy))

In this game, these two spirits are inextricably entwined by the force of nature. Though players are initially separated into different scenes, they must unite as a team, collaborating to gather useful information and solve puzzles by interacting with their surroundings. Once they have located all of the ancient tablet fragments scattered throughout their surroundings, and pieced them together in their proper place, the ornately carved wooden door shall open before them, revealing the culmination of their collective efforts. At this moment, they shall witness the magnificent merging of their memories, previously disparate droplets, into a single, continuous river, restoring their fractured spirits to wholeness once more.

### 1.3 Task Setting


#### 1.3.1 Apolonia’s Tasks

Apolonia’s Tasks are more related to logic. She needs to communicate with Dion frequently to get clues so that she can finish all tasks and get three “keys" to pass the cat keeper. Interaction design for Apolonia would be focused on selection & manipulation.

#### 1.3.2 Dion’s Tasks

Dion’s Tasks are more related to arts. He is the drifter of a world full of imagination and fantasy, and sometimes illusion and absurdity. Optical illusions and surrealism ideas would be used for the task design of Dion. 

## 2. Scene Design

### 2.0 Prologue

**Apollo:**

"In measured strides, his melodies resound,

Harmony and reason in his being found.

**Dionysus:**

"Through frenzied revelry, he finds release,

The chaos and passion, his soul's masterpiece.

**Embark on the journey, let your essence unfurl,**

**For both paths lead to unity's sacred pearl.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/oLbFufj.png)

* There are three tables, each corresponding to one theme in Dion’s world, tasks should be finished clockwise. These tasks are written on a scroll near the Cat Guard, each implicitly implied in a poetic verse. Once Apolonia finishes a task and comes back to the Cat Guard in Jetpack, she’ll find that the corresponding verse will change from black to golden. After she finishes all the tasks, the Cat Guard will let her through the gate…

## 3. Puzzle Design 


### 3.1 Morse Code + Boat Race in Chinese Shan Shui

An unfurled ancient scroll is on the desk, with puzzles written on it. An ancient stone tablet with Morse code alphabet (letters and numbers) written on it is placed in the corner of the room. An input area is on the bottom side of the desk. Apolonia needs to solve the puzzle, encode the answer to Morse code, and input the sequence of dots and dashes into the empty slots to pass this level and obtain the tools at the next level.

> [Morse Code Translator](https://morsedecoder.com/)

The puzzles are all about “[Psychostasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_of_souls)”, after which Apolonia will get a balance scale and weights. It includes:

1. Weighing of the heart, in [ancient Egypt religion](https://egypt-museum.com/the-weighing-of-the-heart-ceremony/)
   1. [Weighing of the Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sDJ0jAcw7U)
   2. [The Egyptian Book of the Dead: A guidebook for the underworld - Tejal Gala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yv_MXNYbAo)




> **As one of the ancient Egyptians, you are to pass through the trial by Osiris to enter the eternal paradise of the Field of Reeds (after-life). Your heart is weighted by ______ in the scale against the feather of Maat. **
>
> Answer: [.- -. ..- -... .. ...]



2. Weighing of souls, [in Christianity](https://www.learnreligions.com/archangel-michael-weighing-souls-124002)
   [Saint Michael Weighing Souls | Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya](https://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/saint-michael-weighing-souls/juan-de-la-abadia-el-vell/005082-000)

> **In Christianity, on Judgment Day, St. _______ the Archangel will hold the scales of judgment and weigh the souls of the resurrected. A righteous soul will tip the balance of the scales downward. **
>
> Answer: [-- .. -.-. .... .- . .-..]



3. [21 grams experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_grams_experiment#:~:text=The%2021%20grams%20experiment%20refers,the%20soul%20departed%20the%20body.)
[The Man Who Tried to Weigh the Soul | Discover Magazine](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/the-man-who-tried-to-weigh-the-soul)

> **The April 1907 issue of American Medicine featured a paper by Dr. Duncan Macdougall who concluded that at the moment of death, there was a loss in weight of about “three-fourths of an ounce”, or __ grams. **
>
> Answer: [..--- .----]



The five input keys include <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a dot key, a dash key, a space key, a delete key, and a confirm key</span>. Once Apolonia presses the confirm key, the input Morse Code will be compared to the right answer. If the input matches the correct answer, the input field will turn green; otherwise, it will turn red. Once Apolonia inputs the correct answer and the input field turns green, the next puzzle will be loaded within 2 seconds (using Unity coroutine).


![](https://i.imgur.com/mZg6dHd.png)


In the meanwhile, Dion needs to complete the boat race along a fixed route and pass all the waypoints in order. When Dion has arrived at one waypoint, there will be signs along the path guiding him to the next. After Dion finishes the race and come to the end point (the ancient scroll), as he drives into the scroll, he is entering the world the next level…


![](https://i.imgur.com/Fb1Byqn.png)

### 3.2 Balance Scale + Nighthawks Universe 

The **balance scale** ⚖️ follows the [Subtractive Color Mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color) 🎨 (such as in a printer) rule: it will be balanced only if weights on the two sides are equal to each other in terms of color. All conditions are listed as follows:

1. cyan + yellow = green


2. cyan + magenta = blue


3. yellow + magenta = red


4. cyan + yellow + magenta = black

Initially, Apolonia can see instructions on the left side of the desk, explaining color mixing and scale constraint (she can put only 1 weight on the left scale and 2 weights on the right); a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span> weight on the right scale; and six other weights (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">red</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cyan</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blue</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">magenta</span>, **black**) aside. 


![](https://i.imgur.com/tGktt03.png)


Dion is in the Nighthawks scene. The bar has four doors with different colors (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">white</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span>). 

Clues about the next color Apolonia should put on the scale and “weigh” are hidden in the poem on the scroll. The whole process will be:

1. Apolonia is asked to tell Dion that she saw a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span> weight on the left of the scale and Dion should find a clue related to this color.


2. So Dion find the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span> door, passes through it and enters the bar. He should find a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span> **scroll **in the scene. The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">yellow</span> scroll says: 

> **"After the torchlight red on sweaty faces**
>
> **After the frosty silence in the gardens**
>
> **After the agony in stony places**
>
> **The shouting and the crying**
>
> **Prison and palace and reverberation**
>
> **Of thunder of spring over distant mountains**
>
> **He who was living is now dead**
>
> **We who were living are now dying**
>
> **With a little patience"**
>
> **—T. S. Eliot, "The Waste Land"**

So, Dion tells Apolonia that the clue is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">red</span>.

3. Then, Apolonia knows that she should put <span style="text-decoration:underline;">red</span> on the left and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">magenta</span> on the right. Once the scale becomes balanced, a verse will appear on the desk, saying: 

> **“Whitespace is to be regarded as an active element, not a passive background”** 
>
> **— Jan Tschichold**

Apolonia tells Dion that the clue is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">white</span>, so Dion knows that he should choose the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">white</span> door** this time and find a **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">white</span> scroll**, which says:

> **“Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread**
>
> **On the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blue</span> surface of thine airy surge,**
>
> **Like the bright hair uplifted from the head”**
>
> **—Percy Bysshe Shelley, "Ode to the West Wind", Canto 2, Stanza 2** 

Dion should tell Apolonia that the clue is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blue</span>.

4. Having obtained the clue, Apolonia knows that she should replace <span style="text-decoration:underline;">red</span> with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blue</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">magenta</span> with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cyan</span>. Once the scale becomes balanced again, a poem appears on the desk:

> **“I will not cease from mental fight,**
>
> **Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,**
>
> **Till we have built Jerusalem**
>
> **In England's <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> and pleasant land.”**
>
> **—William Blake, "And Did Those Feet In Ancient Time"**

Apolonia should tell Dion that the clue is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span>.

5. Dion walks through the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> door and he will find the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> scroll. As the scroll unfurled, Dion finds out that the inside of the scroll is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> apple with a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">black</span> background. The scroll murmurs: “The abyss is calling you. Pass me, through the darkness and to the stars.” Dion tells Apolonia what he saw (including both <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">black</span>). After getting the information, Apolonia knows that now she should put <span style="text-decoration:underline;">black</span> on the left; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">green</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">magenta</span> on the right.


6. Dion follows the calling of abyss and pass through the scroll. He will be transferred to the new scene: Van Gogh’s Cafe Terrace at Night, but it’s silent and lifeless. While on the side of Apolonia, once the scale becomes balanced again, tools that will be manipulated at the next level will show up on the next desk.

### 3.3 Sliding Puzzle + Street Search

Apolonia needs to solve the sliding puzzles which will give hints on the objects Dion should interact with.

1. [The Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man) & [Snow White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_(Disney_character))

![](https://i.imgur.com/aYJyzZm.png)


2. [The Old Guitarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Guitarist)
Apolonia finishes the slide puzzle of [The Old Guitarist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Guitarist); at the same time, Dion will see a spotlight casting on a coin on the street. Dion picks it up. After Apolonia told Dion that the clue was “a man playing guitar in a blue mood”, Dion should easily find the target.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iHJTgb8.png)


3. Picasso and Dali Painting the Egg

![](https://i.imgur.com/8Fmu0F6.png)


Initially, Apolonia can see a blank sci-fi tablet and a red sci-fi button on the table. If she push the button, the first sliding puzzle (The Old Guitarist by Picasso) will show up on the tablet. After she finishes each puzzle, the image will show its complete version (the previous empty piece will come back), the mini-image will appear on top of the button, and the next button will appear.

![](https://i.imgur.com/66GYvit.jpg)


In the meanwhile, Dion will search in the Van Gogh street, the following poems will be sang to him, if he successfully finishes the tasks.

> In the depths of my sorrow, your kindness shines so bright
>
> With this golden coin, you've painted hope in my darkest night
>
> May your soul find solace, in this lovely Starry Starry Night



> Lost in this tapestry of vibrant delight
>
> Where music dances and souls take flight
>
> Come, young wanderer, let us journey through the night


### 3.4 Calp Hands

Two players clap their hands in front of their headsets to activate the animation and enter the final scene, uncover the secret behind all these, and come to the culmination of their adventure.
